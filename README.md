# Personal Blog

This is an archive of my new created blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
Here I'm planing to talk about web development tools, mostyl about Ruby ans its awesome ecosystem.

## Theme used

I'm using Cactus theme by [nickbalestra](http://github.com/nickbalestra/kactus)
This theme is fully compliant with GH Pages and their dependencies.

## Thanks
Most of the work has been already done by the [Cactus for mac authors](https://github.com/koenbok/Cactus/blob/master/AUTHORS), I've just ported their default theme to Jekyll.
I've also added few things specific to Jekyll and some minor style changes.
